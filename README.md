# Mock Up PDF Parsing
The purpose of this mock up is to give a better picture to the hired consultant on how does the team want the code to look like in terms of content, logging and documentation (docstrings, comment, README).

The main script is `script_a.py`, in which all the tools will be called for running the parser
The other scripts contain the tools described on the diagram below:

- `script-b-a.py`: Tools for extracting textual data from PDF/HTMLs
- `script-b-b.py`: Tools for OCR (for PDFs with photos of text)
- `script-b-c.py`: Tools for cleaning text

The scripts don't have to look precisely like this and the documentation can vary depending on the template used for docstrings, etc, but we hope this helps clarify the output we are expecting.
